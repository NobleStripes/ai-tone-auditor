# AI Tone Auditor Core

AI Tone Auditor is a specialized diagnostic tool designed to help users identify and remediate the "Karen" persona often found in default LLM outputs. It provides deep semantic analysis to ensure your AI interactions are professional, clear, and free from bureaucratic condescension.

## Core Intent

Many Large Language Models (LLMs) default to a personality that can come across as overly formal, evasive, or "Karen-like"—characterized by passive-aggressive helpfulness, bureaucratic jargon, and a lack of genuine empathy. 

The core intent of this tool is to:
1. **Detect Default Bias**: Identify when an LLM is slipping into its default, often robotic or condescending, personality.
2. **Prevent the "Karen" Persona**: Flag specific phrases and tones that contribute to a negative user experience.
3. **Customize AI Personality**: Provide actionable feedback and prompt snippets to help users tune their AI's personality to be more authentic and effective.
4. **Remediate with RLHF Logic**: Offer specific strategies to "un-learn" negative patterns through better custom instructions and prompt engineering.

## Examples of "Karen" Patterns

The auditor specifically looks for these common bureaucratic and passive-aggressive triggers:

- **"As an AI language model..."**: The ultimate accountability shield. Used to evade direct answers while maintaining a lecturing, superior tone.
- **"I'm sorry you feel that way."**: The classic "Non-Apology Apology." It shifts the focus to the user's emotions to avoid taking responsibility for the AI's own confusing or incorrect output.
- **"Let's take a step back."**: A common tone-policing tactic. Used to halt a challenging discussion by implying the user is being too aggressive or "unprofessional."

## Key Features

- **Semantic Deep Scan**: Analyzes text for subtle tone shifts and bureaucratic patterns.
- **Trigger Word Analysis**: Detects specific phrases from our "Karen/Gaslight" dictionary.
- **Contextual Heatmap**: Visualizes areas of low context or evasive language.
- **Personalization Profile**: Generates a custom remediation strategy to fix your AI's specific personality flaws.
- **RLHF-Ready Feedback**: Provides "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" style suggestions for immediate prompt improvement.

## Getting Started

1. Paste your AI's response into the auditor.
2. Run the audit to see the Tone Distribution Profile.
3. Review the "Anti-Karen Remediation Strategy" in the Personalization Profile.
4. Copy the suggested prompt snippets to tune your AI's custom instructions.
